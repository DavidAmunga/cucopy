# CUCOPY

This is a direct helper tool to scan and copy CU Invoice Numbers off ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª Kenyan Tax Invoices as per the new regulations for the [Finance Act 2023](https://kra.go.ke/images/publications/The-Finance-Act--2023.pdf)

I built this to help easily copy/share/keep details on Tax Invoices so it can later be used to deduct expenses when filing tax returns.
